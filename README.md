# MiniNT5 Tools

Scripts & Tools to customize Windows PE to my like. Also adds 32 Bit application support to the 64 Bit Windows PE Image.
Really small, ca. 525MiB for the 64 Bit image, ca. 340MiB for the 32 Bit Image.
Can be booted from every media like CD-ROM, USB Sticks and even from Network (PXE).

MiniNT5 is intended for diagnostics, repair & (re-)installation of Windows. (Workstation & Server editions, from Windows 2000 to Windows 10)

### Prerequisites

What things you need to build MiniNT

* [ADK for Windows 10 Version 1709](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=859206)
* Both x86 and x64 DVDs (or ISO) of Windows 10 Version 1709
	* Note that the ADK and Windows 10 ISO must be in EN-US language
* Visual Studio 2017 (I use the Enterprise Edition, other editions may work)
	* Visual Studio 2013 (v120) Platform Toolset
	* .NET 4
* A running Windows 10 1709 or later with Administrator rights to build MiniNT

### Preparation

Preparing the files:

* Delete all "BlankDir.txt" from all folders
* Extract the contents of both Sources\Install.wim from the DVDs to 2 separate folders (security persmissions does not matter)
* Install ADK, make sure that Windows PE Images & Tools are installed, all other tools (like WinDBG) are not required

### Compiling

Compiling MiniNT:

* Open the project "MiniNT5 Tools.sln" in Visual Studio, and compile the project as Release/Win32 and Release/x64
* Go to the folder "MiniNTBuilder" and adapt "paths.cmd" to your like
* Feel free to modify "MiniNT ID.reg" to your like, not needed
* Copy, if needed, some drivers into the Drivers\x86 and Drivers\x64 folder (in a separate folder for each driver) - these will be picked up automatically
* Open a command prompt with administrative permissions, and run the CMD files from 01 to 99

* when all is success, you see 2 files "MiniNT5 32.iso" and "MiniNT5 64.iso" in the root folder of the project
